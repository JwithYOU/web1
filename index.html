<h2>e-commerce
</h2><p>E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the activity of electronically buying or selling of products on online services or over the Internet.
  The term was coined and first employed by Dr. Robert Jacobson, Principal Consultant to the California State Assembly's Utilities & Commerce Committee,
  in the title and text of California's Electronic Commerce Act, carried by the late Commmittee Chairwoman Gwen Moore (D-L.A.) and enacted in 1984.
  Electronic commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing,
  online transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems.
  E-commerce is in turn driven by the technological advances of the semiconductor industry, and is the largest sector of the electronics industry.
Modern electronic commerce typically uses the World Wide Web for at least one part of the transaction's life cycle although
it may also use other technologies such as e-mail. Typical e-commerce transactions include the purchase of online books (such as Amazon) and
music purchases (music download in the form of digital distribution such as iTunes Store), and to a less extent, customized/personalized online liquor
store inventory services.[1] There are three areas of e-commerce: online retailing, electronic markets, and online auctions.
 E-commerce is supported by electronic business. From WIKIPIDIA</p></body></html>
